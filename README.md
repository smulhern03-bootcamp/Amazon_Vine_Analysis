# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The following is an analysis of the Amazon reviews for videogames written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.  

## Results
Of the 37,475 reviews that fit the criteria (more than 20 votes and 50% or more of those were labeled "helpful"), the following results were generated:

 * Total number of Vine reviews - 90
 * Total number of non-Vine reviews - 37,385
 
 * Total number of 5-star Vine reviews - 44
 * Total number of 5-star non-Vine reviews - 14,626
 
 * Percent of Vines that were 5-star - 11.7%
 * Percent of non-Vines that were 5-star - 39%
 
## Summary
Based upon the video games reviews and the subset analyized, there does not appear to be positivity bias within the Vine program.  Using 5-star as a threshold, 11.7% were Vines and considered helpful.  However, the sample size is too small to come to a strong conclusion.  Vine video game reviews only account for .25% of all reviews within the sample.  In order to get a more robust analysis, 4 or 5 star reviews should included.  If the total sample size continues to be overly small, video games may not be the best product to perform analysis.  A different, more widely utilized product (movies, music, electronics) may proved better results and analysis.
